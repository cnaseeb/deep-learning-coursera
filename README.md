# Deep-Learning-Coursera

Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base (without the solution), and images, are taken from, unless specified otherwise, <https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning>. Solutions were implemented by me. 

The notebooks and corresponding python files are uploaded by each course (respectively):

## 1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
    
    a. Logistic Regression with a neural network Mindset
  
    b. Implement a neural network with a single hidden layer
      
    c. Building your Deep neural network (step by step)
  
    d. Deep neural Network Application: Classification (Cat vs Non-Cat images)

## 2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
    
    a. Initialization (model regularization and hyperparameter tuning)
    
    b. Regularization methods and Dropout implementation
    
    c. Gradient Checking to ensure that the backpropagation implementation is correct
    
    d. Optimization methods (to Understand the intuition between Adam and RMS prop, Recognize the importance of mini-batch gradient             descent, and Learn the effects of momentum on the overall performance of your model)
    
    e. Build a deep neural network model to recognize numbers from 0 to 5 in sign language 
    
    
## 3. Convolutional Neural Networks:

    a. Building a Conolutional Model (CONV, POOL layers and backpropagation)
  
    b. CONVNet Model Application: Implement CONVNet using TensorFlow (detection hand signs for numbers)
  
    c. Autonomous Car Detection application using YOLO algorithm
  
    d. Deep Learning & Art: Neural Style Transfer
    
    e. Face Recognition for the Happy House
  
## 4. Sequence Models

    a. Building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model 
  
    b. Dinosaurs and Character level language Model
  
    c. LSTM to generate music (Jazsolo)
  
    d. Operations on word vectors (Word Embeddings, Word Analogy, reduce gender bias)
    
    e. Neural machine Translation with Attention Model (HR date to MR date translation)
    
    f. Trigger word detection (Wakeword detection)
