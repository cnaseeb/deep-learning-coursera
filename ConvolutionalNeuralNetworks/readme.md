This directory contains implementations for Convolutional Neural Networks, especially for the following projects:

  a. Building a Conolutional Model (CONV, POOL layers and backpropagation)

  b. CONVNet Model Application: Implement CONVNet using TensorFlow (detection hand signs for numbers)

  c. Autonomous Car Detection application using YOLO algorithm

  d. Deep Learning & Art: Neural Style Transfer

  e. Face Recognition for the Happy House
